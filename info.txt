The silks created by weavers in Baghdad were inspired by the beautiful and varied colors and markings of cat coats. These fabrics were called 'tabby' by European traders.
A cat cannot see directly under its nose.
The first official cat show in the UK was organised at Crystal Palace in 1871.
Cats have about 130,000 hairs per square inch (20,155 hairs per square centimeter).
